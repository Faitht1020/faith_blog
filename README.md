Building a blog-app, using node js, express and, mongoDB
I created a root directory for my project, created some folders and files I need for the project under it, such as the route, middleware, controller folders, 
also, the server file and the environment setup file. I downloaded the packages and dependencies I need too, such as express, ejs, mongoose, body-parser and dotenv.
I require my packages and dependencies in my server file and I  initialized them. I also require the path to my route in thesame fille and they were all used in the file, 
I also called and listen to my port in my sever file, I set up the port and local host in my .env file. I created a file in my route folder and require express, 
the middleware file and the controller file in it, I also initialize my route and use it to get what I created in the middleware and controller files. In my controller folder,
I created a file and perform a create operation in it from which I sent a response. In my middleware folder I created a file in which I perform some operations that can help 
to condition my work and track my errors. I completed the create, update, read and delete operations in my controller.js file and route each of the operations in my route.js file. I now fully understand the CRUD operations, models and schema, node.js, express and mongo DB and can  now build simple applications with them.
